Boilerplate for AngularJS
=========================

This is a basic boilerplate to help get started with writing a project in AngularJS.
You will need to have Node installed.

--------------------

<h3>Start Up:</h3>

Navigate to your local repo

Install all of the dependencies:
`npm install`

Install a local server. This boilerplate uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server:
`npm install http-server`

Build the project:
`gulp build`

Start the gulp watcher (optional):
`gulp`

Open a new command prompt and navigate to your repo and start the server:
`http-server ./build`

In the command prompt, you should see the url that the project is serving to.
