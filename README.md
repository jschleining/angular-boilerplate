Boilerplate for AngularJS
=========================

This is a basic boilerplate to help get started with writing a project in AngularJS.
You will need to have Node installed.

--------------------

<h3>Start Up:</h3>

Navigate to your local repo

Install all of the dependencies:
```npm install```

Install a local server. This boilerplate uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server:
```npm install http-server```

Build the project:
```gulp build```

Start the gulp watcher (optional):
```gulp```

If you are running gulp, open a new command prompt and navigate to your repo and start the server,
otherwise just start the server from the same command prompt:
```http-server ./build```

In the command prompt, you should see the url that the project is serving to.
